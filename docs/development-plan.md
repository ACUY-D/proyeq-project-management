## Technical Implementation Approach

### Frontend Stack
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Redux Toolkit or Zustand for state management
- TailwindCSS for styling with a custom design system
- React Router for navigation
- react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop functionality
- D3.js or similar for data visualization
- Vite for fast development and building

### Backend Stack
- Supabase for database, authentication, and real-time features
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- Supabase Auth for user management
- Supabase Real-time for instant updates
- Supabase Functions for serverless backend logic

## Development Workflow

Following the BMAD METHOD, we will:
1. Create a new branch for each story
2. Implement the story in the branch
3. Get feedback and make adjustments
4. Merge the branch when approved
5. Deploy to staging environment
6. Get user feedback
7. Iterate based on feedback

## Feedback Loop

After each phase, we will:
1. Deploy to a staging environment
2. Request feedback from stakeholders
3. Make necessary adjustments
4. Proceed to the next phase when approved

## Timeline

The project will be developed in iterative cycles of 1-2 weeks per phase, with feedback periods between each phase. The estimated total development time is 3-4 months for a full-featured MVP.
